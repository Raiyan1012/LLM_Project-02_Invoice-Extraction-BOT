#Project_02
This invoice extraction bot is a smart tool that uses the hashtag#openai language model to automate data retrieval from PDF invoices. Additionally, there's a provision for using hashtag#llama2 model hosted on Replicate, demonstrating flexibility in the choice of AI engines. It reads PDFs using hashtag#pypdf, extracts details like invoice number, items, prices, and contact info with hashtag#regex , and processes the data through AI for accuracy. The bot can handle multiple files, structures the extracted info into a hashtag#pandas DataFrame, and the data can be downloaded as a CSV file. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of hashtag#AI with Python for efficient data management. 

You can find all the codes in my GitHub repo. 

I have used hashtag#OpenAI, hashtag#llama2 (optional, in case, I want to switch from hashtag#OpenAi), hashtag#LangChain , and hashtag#Streamlit
